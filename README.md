### Hello there! Welcome to my GitHub!

🚀 My name is Pedro and I recently finished **Le Wagon's Data Science Bootcamp (Batch #869)**! 🚀

👨‍💻 After **+10 years** working as an Architect & Urban Planner, I developed a major interest in **Data Analysis & Data Science**. 👨‍💻

🤓 Now, I'm starting this new professional path with lots of energy, interest and dedication! 🤓

🙋‍ Feel free to contact me, ask me questions, send some suggestions, invite me to a coffee... 🙋‍♂️
